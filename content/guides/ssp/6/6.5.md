**System Inventory Approach**
OSCAL makes two approaches available for depicting the system inventory:

- **Flat-File Approach**: Similar to today's FedRAMP Integrated inventory workbook, where all of the information on a spreadsheet row is captured in a single assembly.
- **Component-Based Approach**: A component is defined once with as much known detail as possible, and inventory-items point to components for common information. 

FedRAMP prefers the component-based approach, accepts the flat-file approach to aid CSPs who are converting their existing MS-Excel based FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook to OSCAL. **FedRAMP SSP tools must support both approaches.**

*Flat-File Inventory Approach*

With the **flat-file approach**, all content on a spreadsheet row appears in a single OSCAL inventory-item assembly. This results in a great deal of redundant information but is a simple transition from the current spreadsheet approach.

With the **component-based approach**, common information is captured once in a component assembly. Each instance of that component has its own inventory-item assembly, which cites the relevant component and only includes information unique to that instance.

For example, if the same Linux operating system is used as the platform for all database and web servers, most of the details about the Linux operating system can be captured once as a component. This includes information such as vendor name, version number, and patch level.

*Component-based Inventory Approach*

If four Linux instances are used, each instance is an inventory item with a unique IP address and MAC address. Only those unique pieces are captured at the ![](Aspose.Words.7bfddc9e-5b98-4429-b7c2-765eea0b5316.129.png)inventory level. All four inventory-items point back to the component for vendor name, version 	number, and patch level.
