If this system is leveraging the authorization of one or more systems, such as a SaaS running on an IaaS, each leveraged system must be represented within the system-implementation assembly. There must be one leveraged-authorization assembly and one matching component assembly for each leveraged authorization.

The leveraged-authorization assembly includes the leveraged system's name, POC, and authorization date. The component assembly must be linked to the leveraged-authorization assembly using a property (prop) field with the name leveraged-authorization-uuid and the UUID value of its associated leveraged-authorization assembly. The component assembly enables controls to reference it with the by-component responses described in *Section 5.4, Control Implementation Descriptions**. The implementation-point property value must be set to "external".

Additional information is required within each control. See *Section 5.4.9, Leveraged Authorization Response: Inheriting Controls, Satisfying Responsibilities** for more information.

If the leveraged system owner provides a UUID for their system, such as in an OSCAL-based Inheritance and Responsibility document (similar to a CRM), it should be provided as the inherited-uuid property value.
