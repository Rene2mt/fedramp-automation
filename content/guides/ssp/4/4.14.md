**NOTE:** 

- A cloud service provider may define one and only one cloud deployment model in the system security plan for a cloud service offering.
- OSCAL 1.0.0 permits a cloud-deployment-model of value community-cloud, but FedRAMP does not permit such a deployment model for cloud service offerings and is not permitted for a FedRAMP OSCAL-based system security plan.
- If the deployment model is "hybrid", the remarks field is required. Otherwise it is optional.
