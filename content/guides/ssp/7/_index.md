The following artifacts are historically generated by hand to summarize content found in other portions of the FedRAMP SSP. When using OSCAL, these artifacts can be generated from content found elsewhere in this document. This includes the:

- **Control Information Summary (CIS)**
- **Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM)**

If delivering SSP content in OSCAL, CSPs are no longer required to manually generate and maintain these artifacts, provided the content in their OSCAL-based FedRAMP SSP remains accurate.

**Tool developers are encouraged to develop their own solutions to generating this content.**
