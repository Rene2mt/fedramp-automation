When the current system is inheriting a control from or meeting customer responsibilities defined by an underlying authorization , the leveraged system must first be defined as described in *Section 4.15, Leveraged Authorizations** before it may be referenced in a control response. The by-component assembly references these components. 

IMPORTANT: The leveraged system may provide a single component representing the entire leveraged system, or may provide individual system components as well. In either case, the inherited-uuid property in the component when defined in the leveraging system's SSP. This is the
