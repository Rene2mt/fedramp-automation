There must always be a “This System“ component in the SSP. This is used in several ways: 
- **Holistic Overview**: If the SSP author wishes to provide a more holistic overview of how several components work together, even if details are provided individually in other by-component assemblies.
- **Catch-all**: Any control response that does not cleanly align with another system component may be described in the the “This System“ component. 
- **Legacy SSP Conversion**: When converting a legacy SSP to OSCAL, the legacy control response statements may initially be associated with the “This System“ component until the SSP author is able to provide responses for individual components.

**NOTES:**

- Although the name of the component is “This System“, non-technical solutions may also be discussed here, such as policies and procedures.
