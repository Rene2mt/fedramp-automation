This section describes the modeling of security control information in an OSCAL-based FedRAMP SSP. To ensure consistent processing, FedRAMP imposes specific requirements on the use of OSCAL for control implementation information. 

The modeling of controls is addressed in the following sections as follows:

- **Section 5.1, Control Definitions****
- **Section 5.2, Responsible Roles Responsible Roles and Parameter Assignments**
- **Section 5.3, Implementation Status****
- **Section 5.3.1.1, Control Origination****
- **Section 5.4, Control Implementation Descriptions****
  - **Organization**
    - **Policy and Procedure Statements**
    - **Multi-Part Statements**
    - **Single Statements**
  - **Response**
    - **Overview**
    - **Example**
    - **“This System“**
    - **Inheriting from a Leveraged Authorization**
    - **Identifying Customer Responsibilities**
    - **Providing Inheritance**

This section provides the preferred approach to representing controls in OSCAL. For system owners converting their MS Word-based SSP to OSCAL, see Appendix B*, Converting a Legacy SSP to* OSCAL* for an alternative OSCAL control representation, which aligns better with legacy SSP content.
