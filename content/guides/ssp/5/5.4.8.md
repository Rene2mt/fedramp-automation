title: 5.4.8 Response-Identifying Inheritable Controls and Customer Responsibilities

For systems that may be leveraged, OSCAL enables a robust mechanism for providing both inheritance details as well as customer responsibilities (referred to as consumer responsibilities by NIST). OSCAL is designed to enable leveraged and leveraging system SSP details to be linked by tools for validation.

Within the appropriate by-component assembly, include an export assembly. Use provided to identify a capability that may be inherited by a leveraging system. Use responsibility to identify a customer responsibility. If a responsibility must be satisfied to achieve inheritance, add the provided-uuid flag to the responsibility field.
