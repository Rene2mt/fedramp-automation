<p align= "center"><b> Converting Legacy SSPs to OSCAL</b></p>

For CSPs converting their existing MS Word-based SSP to OSCAL, FedRAMP allows the entire part response to initially be associated with the "THIS SYSTEM" component. Once converted, the CSP is encouraged to begin defining individual components and move content from the general “THIS SYSTEM”“ description to the component-specific description.
<br>

See Appendix B*, Converting a Legacy SSP to* OSCAL* for an alternative OSCAL control representation, which aligns better with legacy SSP content.
